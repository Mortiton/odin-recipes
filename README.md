# odin-recipes
This is my first project while working through The Odin Project This is a basics recipe website with an index page and some links to recipes.

At this moment in time I am covering the HTML basics.

After completion of this project the skills I will have demostrated:
- Using html elements and attributes to structure the page
- using links to link to recipes
